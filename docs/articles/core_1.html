<p>This course will focus on what I believe are the essential skills
necessary for a laboratory-based scientist to use R and Rstudio in an
effective way. There are many other detailed resources out there for
you.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/previous/" class="external-link">Software
carpentry</a> has very good tutorials for R, python, git and working
with the command line.<br>
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://r4ds.had.co.nz/" class="external-link">R for data science</a> is a book
written by Hadley Wickham who wrote much of the software we use in
R</li>
<li>
<a href="https://moderndive.com/" class="external-link">Modern dive</a> is focused on
modeling if you are interested in more clinical data sets</li>
</ul>
<p>These and many others are good resources if you want to extend your
knowledge beyond what we cover here.</p>
<p>Learning R at times will seem like learning a foreign language. You
will make errors. <strong>Start by trying your best and then ask AI for
help</strong>. This is how you learn.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="r-and-rstudio">R and Rstudio<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#r-and-rstudio"></a>
</h2>
<p>R is a statistical programming language that runs as a computer
program. Rstudio is known as an integrated development environment or
IDE. It is the <strong>best</strong> way for humans to interact with the
R program.</p>
<p>Rstudio provides two main ways of interacting with R: directly via
the R Console and via R scripts.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>R console: you type in commands and output is usually returned to
the console. The commands are logged in a history file if you really
need them, but this is inconvenient. A better option is to use
scripts.</p>
<p><strong>Warning and Error messages will appear in the console. Always
pay attention to what they are saying.</strong></p>
</li>
<li><p>R scripts: these are text files, usually in the form of
<filename>.R. When you run 1 or more lines, Rstudio feeds them into the
console and R follows the commands. This is good because you always have
a plain text record of what you did. So when you build up a multi-step
analysis it is easy to see how you got the end product.</filename></p></li>
</ul>
<p>Better than running the whole file line by line is “sourcing” the
file. You can do this by typing Ctrl+Shift+S or clicking the “Source”
button in the upper right corner of the source pane (usually top-left)
in Rstudio. Why is this better? Let’s say you left an error in your
script. Maybe the presence of this error changes the final output you
are trying to produce. If you run all of the lines, R will notify you of
the error and then keep going. Easy to miss if this is the only error.
If you source the file, it will stop completely on errors so you don’t
end up with errors you aren’t aware of.</p>
<p><strong>You always want your programs to error in obvious ways so you
don’t carry on with incorrect data.</strong></p>
<p>Rstudio provides a number of standard panes that display useful
information. These work very well out of the box and don’t need
modification. They include a source (script) editor, and 3 tabbed
windows that give you access to the console, the computer terminal, a
graphical file explorer, help information, a plot viewer, a
workspace/environment viewer (more on that later), git status etc.</p>
<p>By default, R studio gives you the option to save your workspace data
when you close out a session and then to reload your workspace from that
file the next time you start to work. This is generally not a good idea,
for reasons we will see. It wastes time loading and quitting sessions
and you want to be explicit in what objects you are saving, if and when
you save them.</p>
<p>To turn this off, go to the Rstudio menu bar, select Tools, then
Global Options. Make the following selections in the pop-up window:</p>

<h2 id="setting-up-your-system">Setting up your system<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#setting-up-your-system"></a>
</h2>
<p><strong>Note this section is fairly detailed. It is recommended if
you want to work on your own system. If you are part of a multiuser
system that someone else is managing, you can skip it.</strong></p>
<p>I recommend this approach to setting up your R installation. In
comparison to other methods, the blaseRtemplates method provides greater
transparency and reproducibility and an improved user experience
(faster, fewer confusing messages).</p>
<p>First, install the blaseRtemplates package using whatever package
installer you currently use. Assuming the base install function,
run:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span><span class="fu"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/utils/install.packages.html" class="external-link">install.packages</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="st">'blaseRtemplates'</span>, repos <span class="op">=</span> <span class="fu"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/c.html" class="external-link">c</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="st">'https://blaserlab.r-universe.dev'</span><span class="op">)</span><span class="op">)</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Next, simply run the following command:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span><span class="kw"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/library.html" class="external-link">library</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="st"><a href="https://github.com/blaserlab/blaseRtemplates" class="external-link">"blaseRtemplates"</a></span><span class="op">)</span></span>
<span><span class="fu"><a href="https://blaserlab.github.io/blaseRtemplates/reference/establish_new_bt.html" class="external-link">establish_new_bt</a></span><span class="op">(</span>cache_path <span class="op">=</span> <span class="st">"&lt;some_directory&gt;/r_4_5_cache"</span>, project_path <span class="op">=</span> <span class="st">"&lt;some_directory&gt;/projects"</span><span class="op">)</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>What will this do?</p>
<ul>
<li>It will create directories where indicated, write a standard
.Rprofile document, and modify the user .Renviron file to configure R
properly.<br>
</li>
<li>It will not overwrite existing directories and will fail when an
existing installation is already present in the same location.<br>
</li>
<li>The only modification outside of the provided directory is to the
.Renviron file. If you have existing configurations in your .Renviron
file, they will only be changed if they are conflicting. If this is
problematic, then you should archive your .Renviron file before running.
The new .Renviron file will cause R to use the new .Rprofile in the
cache directory and skip existing user- and project-level
.Rprofiles.</li>
</ul>
<p>When R starts a new session, it looks for a series of files to
configure itself. This configuration includes environment variables (in
the .Renviron file) and any desired R code (in the .Rprofile file). As
included in this function, these configurations only affect user
experience i.e. they should not affect the results produced by your
code. By user experience I mean connection to the proper package
libraries and repositories and some safeguards to prevent working
outside of projects.</p>
<p>For more information on how R starts, see <a href="https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/Startup.html" title="R startup" class="external-link">this link.</a>.</p>

<h3 id="directory-structure">Directory Structure<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#directory-structure"></a>

<pre><code>.

<p>First, note that two main subdirectories have been created in one
parent directory. This is optional and can be specified by the function
inputs, but for a single user system it is recommended to keep them
together for the sake of organization.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>projects: where your projects should be initialized. They can go
anywhere but you should keep them here. The baseproject is created by
the establish_new_bt function. If you close a project without moving to
a new one or try to start a session outside of a project, it will bounce
you here. This prevents undesired operations in e.g. the home directory
or elsewhere.</p></li>
<li>
<p>r_4_5_cache: This holds all of the inner workings of the
blaseRtemplates system.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>library: The versioned/hashed package binary cache. Each package
is stored under the following rubric: name &gt; version &gt; hash &gt;
name &gt; contents. This structure is generated whenever blaseRtemplates
installs a new package in any project.</p></li>
<li><p>logs: collection of .Rhistory files. Rather than 1 endless file
(default), blaseRtemplates will store history files for each session by
user and date/time</p></li>
<li><p>source: Package source files. Used by the installer,
pak.</p></li>
<li><p>user_project: A collection of symlinks to versioned/hashed
packages in the library. This is identified as the first entry in
.libPaths() so it is where R looks first for packages. Why do this? 1.
It allows reproducibility. If I update a package for one project, it may
break something in an older project. This allows each project to have
its own set of packages. (The list of what versions are used is kept as
a tsv file within the project, so it is completely portable. Anyone who
wants to replicate your code just has to install that list of packages.)
2. It makes the system lightweight. Package code and more significantly,
data, is stored in one location and accessible to many projects,
according to version.</p></li>
<li><p>dependency_catalog.tsv: a list of package dependencies by package
hash. Speeds up installation when linking packages from the cache to a
project.</p></li>
<li><p>package_catalog.tsv: the master catalog of packages available in
the cache.</p></li>
<li><p>.Rprofile: the Rprofile used on startup, as specified by the new
.Renviron file</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The library directory is initially populated using all packages
available to R the local libraries. Depending on what is in those
libraries, and processing/network speeds, this may take some time.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="projects">Projects<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#projects"></a>
</h2>
<p>A project is a self-contained group of files for your R data
analysis. This should align conceptually with your experiments. If you
have a set of single cell data and imaging data related to the same
scientific concept or paper then it can all go in the same project.</p>
<p>Projects automatically define their working directory to be the root
of the projects. That means you can reference any file in the root
directory by typing its name like so: “file.R”. If that file was one
directory down, it would be “directory/file.R”. <strong>There is never
any reason to change your working directory to something other than the
project root.</strong></p>
<p>You always want to be working in a project.</p>
<p>Another way to think about your project is this: it is a big set of
scripted instructions that converts your data into figures, tables and
other useful documents that you can directly use in your thesis or
manuscript. These instructions are all in the form of text documents
that reside in the project. Nothing besides these text-based
instructions should be in your project and no critical instructions
should be saved external to your project. <strong>You will want to use
GIT to track your changes to these instructions over time and GITHUB to
share them with collaborators, journal reviewers, and the scientific
community.</strong> THe blaseRtemplates project structure will help you
do all of this in a sensible way.</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="setting-up-a-project">Setting up a project<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#setting-up-a-project"></a>
</h3>
<p>The best way to do this is through automated commands, rather than
through the program menus. This way every package is set up in a
consistent manner, every time. Then when you have to revisit a project
after months and months, it is easy to navigate.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb4"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span><span class="co"># create a project called rclass_project_2023 in your projects directory</span></span>

<p>That function will create the skeletonized project, activate it and
restart your session within it.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="project-organization">Project organization<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#project-organization"></a>
</h3>
<p>I keep all of my R scripts in a directory called “R”. If you
initialized your project with
<code><a href="https://blaserlab.github.io/blaseRtemplates/reference/initialize_project.html" class="external-link">blaseRtemplates::initialize_project()</a></code>, you will have
scripts named:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>initialization.R</code>: use this for setting up your project
to use git and github<br>
</li>
<li>
<code>dependencies.R</code>: use this for loading data and attaching
packages to your session</li>
<li>
<code>configs.R</code>: use this for setting graphical and aesthetic
parameters. I also use this for resolving function name conflicts.</li>
<li>
<code>git_commands.R</code>: the commands here will allow you to
handle 99% of git interactions via R in a scripted way.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to this, the main analysis scripts for the project will
go in the R folder and may go in subdirectories if there are a lot of
them. Other file types, such as *.Rmd, would go in their own folder
named Rmd/. This arrangement is very flexible for simple data analysis
projects; the rules become more strict when we build packages.</p>

<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="git-and-github">Git and github<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#git-and-github"></a>
</h3>
<p>You want to try to use git and github. There is a vast array of
resources for you to read about git and troubleshoot issues. Briefly, it
is a program that tracks changes to text files. Since all of the code
you will write is text-based this is a great resource for you to keep
track of your progress on your work.</p>
<p>Git tracks changes to files in a group of files known as a
repository. The way we are using it here, your project is the
repository. Github is simply a website that hosts a copy of your
repository on the web. This is how you will share your work with journal
reviewers and editors and others.</p>

</h3>
<p>There are some things you need to do to connect git, github and R for
the first time. These lines are included at the bottom of the file,
“R/git_commands.R”. They start out in every project and I usually leave
them in there. Sometimes there are connection issues with github and you
have to run these again to get new credentials.</p>

<p>Connecting/authenticating to github is the most difficult part of all
of this. The keychain program used by <code>gitcreds_set()</code> may
not be available or working on all systems. As a workaround, you can
replace the line in your .Renviron file,
GITHUB_PAT=gitcreds::gitcreds_get(use_cache = FALSE)$password, with
GITHUB_PAT=your_token. There is a small security risk to this if someone
were to gain access to your .Renviron file. So proceed with caution.</p>
<p>The necessary permissions should be set automatically by these
commands. By default, the token expires after 30 days, but you can
override this which is what I usually do.</p>

</h3>
<p>You can interact with git in at least 4 different ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>via scripted commands on <code>R/git_commands.R</code>
</li>
<li>using the Git pane in Rstudio</li>
<li>using the terminal</li>
<li>using a third-party git client such as <a href="https://www.gitkraken.com/" class="external-link">git kraken</a> or <a href="https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/" class="external-link">sourcetree</a>
</li>
</ul>
<p>My recommended approach is to use the scripted git commands to
control what is happening and to use the Git pane to monitor the status
of your repository. Just remember to hit the refresh icon if things look
strange in the Git panel.</p>
<p>On rare occasions you may need to use the terminal to fix conflicts,
but this should only happen if you are collaborating with git.</p>
<p>Many people use third-party apps, but these have their own learning
curve.</p>
<p>The basic process for using Git as a single user is this:</p>
<ul>
<li>save all of your open files</li>
<li>check the status of your repository so you know what files have
changed</li>
<li>add them to the Git index of files</li>
<li>commit them to create a save point for all of the files in your
project</li>
<li>push the commit to the remote repository (github)</li>
</ul>

<p>That is it!</p>
<p>If you run into problems, the error messages are usually informative.
If you have trouble understanding an error or it isn’t helpful, just ask
AI.</p>
<p>One common use-case for git for the single user is to “un-delete”
files. The easiest way is to go to your github site for that repo. Click
on clock icon labeled “commits” (which helpfully includes a “back in
time” arrow). Then select from the list of commits (versions). Click
browse files and find what you were looking for. Click on the raw
version to copy and paste directly back into R studio.</p>
<p>Here’s a more complicated situation most of us can relate to:</p>
<ul>
<li>You submit your beautiful manuscript to Journal A</li>
<li>Journal A bounces it right back to you</li>
<li>You reformat all of the figures for your paper in R and submit it to
Journal B</li>
<li>Journal B is more interested, and they send it out for review and 6
weeks later reject it.</li>
<li>You decide to submit to Journal C which has similar figure
formatting as does Journal A.</li>
<li>What do you do?</li>
</ul>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb8"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span><span class="co"># run these commands to rewind to a prior "good" commit ----------------------</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span class="co"># make sure git status is "clean" (all changes committed) before rewinding</span></span>
<span><span class="co"># gert::git_log() #find the id of the good commit</span></span>
<span><span class="co"># blaseRtemplates::git_rewind_to(commit = "&lt;good commit id&gt;")</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Hopefully you have a commit in your git log with the message
“submitted to Journal A”. You select that id (the long character string)
and provide it to the <code><a href="https://blaserlab.github.io/blaseRtemplates/reference/git_rewind_to.html" class="external-link">blaseRtemplates::git_rewind_to()</a></code>
function. This function will generate a new commit that reverses all of
your changes from present, back to the indicated commit. Nothing is lost
or overwritten in the process of going back in time. The only thing that
happens is that inverse changes are applied. So if you need to go to
Journal D (which is formatted like Journal B) you can always do that
later.</p>

<h2 id="packages">Packages<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#packages"></a>
</h2>
<p>Packages are chunks of code and/or data that people have written and
made available to us to use. The main reason we use R is that there is a
large library of useful packages for the biological sciences that we can
build our work on, all of which are free to use. We can also easily
package our own data which is a great way to archive and distribute your
work.</p>
<p>Packages are most often stored and distributed via standard
repositories. The most common are <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/" class="external-link">CRAN</a>, <a href="https://r-universe.dev/search/" class="external-link">R-universe</a>, and <a href="https://www.bioconductor.org/" class="external-link">Bioconductor</a>. Packages can also
be distributed as source code (text based files), usually via
github.</p>
<p><strong>What happens when we “install” packages?</strong></p>
<p>R downloads the compressed file and then unpacks it in a library
directory on your computer or server. IF you are installing from source
code (most linux computers or github repositories), then the code needs
to be turned into a set of binary instructions for the computer to use,
a process called compiling. This is what the Xcode (Mac) and RTools
(Win) programs do.</p>
<p>Every time you start an R session, a set of commands is run that
points R to one or more library directories. This is how R finds the
commands you ask it to use. Unfortunately, it can be difficult to find
where these directories live and to know which one is being used at any
particular time. blaseRtemplates helps manage this.</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="installing-packages">Installing packages<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#installing-packages"></a>
</h3>
<p>As mentioned above, blaseRtemplates-based projects use a user-project
library that is linked to specific package versions in the main cache.
This way, each project you start can use its own set of packages without
duplication of the actual software. More importantly, if you update a
package in project B, it doesn’t update the package in project A. Why is
this good? Because unintentional updates may “break” an older project
which is something you want to avoid.</p>
<p>The best way to install packages using blaseRtemplates is this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Install a new package or get the latest version from a
repository</li>
</ul>

<p>You can find a human-readable table with all of the packages in the
cache at BLASERTEMPLATES_CACHE_ROOT/package_catalog.tsv. Each package in
the cache is “hashed”. This means that even if there are two different
versions of the same package that share the same version number, you can
still tell them apart and install the one you need.</p>
<p>This shouldn’t happen but it can if someone updates a package but
forgets to increment the version number.</p>

<p>You can find a human-readable table with all of the packages used by
a given project in the library_catalogs directory of the project. There
is at least one file in there. For projects collaborating through git,
there will be one for each user. These files indicate all available and
actively used packages in the R code. This file is meant to be tracked
by git and so can provide version control and reproducibility for the
packages used in your project. If you and a collaborator are getting
different results or errors, you can use this to see exactly which
package set you are working with.</p>
